## Overview

The Shopping System is a Java-based application that provides a text-based interface for users to simulate a shopping experience. It includes functionalities for viewing products, adding or removing items from a cart, and checking out with a final bill.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays available products with prices.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add or remove items, and view current cart status.
- **Checkout**: Calculates total cost, displays final cart summary, and exits the session.
- **Menu Navigation**: Simple numeric-based input for a smooth CLI experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core language used for object-oriented design and application logic.
- **Java Collections**: Used for managing lists of products and cart items.
- **OOP Principles**: Classes used for modeling products, shopping logic, and cart functionality.

## Lessons Learned

Building this project helped reinforce:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Designing clear class structures for products, cart, and system logic.
- **Menu-driven CLI Design**: Handling user input via console menus and switch-case logic.
- **Collections Framework**: Efficient use of lists to track inventory and cart items.
- **Code Modularity**: Separating responsibilities across classes for better readability and maintainability.
- **Input Validation**: Safely handling unexpected or invalid user inputs.
